# SRR_CSRR_Models
Analytical model of the Split Ring Resonator and its Complementary

Based on the expressions in  
Juan Domingo Baena Doello et al, "Equivalent-Circuit Models for the Split-Ring Resonators and Complementary Split-Ring Resonators 
Coupled to Planar Transmission Lines", IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2005 

Only the particule models are included for the moment.
